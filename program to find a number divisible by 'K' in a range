/*
 Numbers divisible by 'K' in a range.

Write a program that given three integers A, B and K, prints the number of integers within the range [A - B] that are divisible by K.

For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
A <= B.

Note : The file/class should be named as "DivisibleByKInRange" with appropriate file extension.

Input Format : 
The first line of input consists of a single Integer A (lower range).
The second line of input consists of a single Integer B (upper range).
The third line of input consists of a single Integer K.

Output Format : 
Output consists of a single integer which is the number of integers divisible by K within the range A-B.

Test Case 1:
Input : 
	5
	15
	6
Output : 
	2

Test Case 2:
Input : 
	2
	9
	1
Output : 
	8 

Test Case 3:
Input : 
	2
	10
	2
Output : 
	5

Test Case 4:
Input : 
	8
	23
	4
Output : 
	4 

Test Case 5:
Input : 
	10
	20
	8
Output : 
	1
