/*
 Write a program to find the dominator element of an array.

An array A consisting of N integers is given. The dominator of array A is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.

For example, consider array A such that
A[0] = 3 A[1] = 4 A[2] = 3 A[3] = 2 A[4] = 3 A[5] = -1 A[6] = 3 A[7] = 3

The dominator of A is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of A (namely in those with indices 0, 2, 4, 6 and 7) and 5 is more than a 

half of 8.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].

Note : The file/class should be named as "DominatorElement" with appropriate file extension.

Input Format : 
First line of input consists of a single integer 'N' which is the size of the array.
Next N lines consists of N integers which are part of the array A.

Output Format : 
Output consists of a single integer which is the dominator of the given array. If no such element is found print -1.

Test case 1: 
Input : 
	8
	2
	34
	33
	11
